How to use the Facebook comment function
-------------------------

We have a Facebook comment for each items, you can setup your own Appid according to the following steps.

* Step 1: Get your own Appid from facebook

  1. Goto [Facebook for developpers](https://developers.facebook.com/?locale=en_US) and login to your account.
  2. Click **My Apps** in the top right corner and click **Add New App** to add your own facebook app.
  3. Fill in the **Display Name**, give your app a name.
  4. Click **Creat App ID**.
  5. At the top of the new page you will see your Appid like **APP ID: 3798490625XXXXX**, click it and it will be copied automatically.
-------------------------
* Step 2: Add your Appid into the config file

  1. The config file ```/src/config/config.json``` is like this.

      ```json
      {
        "user": "vitraux",
        "services": [
          "http://argos2.hypertopic.org",
          "http://steatite.hypertopic.org"
        ],
        "customization": {
          "vitraux": {
            "facebookComment":{
              "enable":false,
              "Appid":"YOUR_APPID_HERE"
            }
          }
        }
      }
      ```
  2. If you want to enable this function, set the ```enable``` in ```facebookComment``` from ```false``` to ```true```.
  3. When you set the ```enable``` to ```true```, you can now paste your Appid get in **Step 1** to ```Appid``` in ```facebookComment```. Here is an example of the last version of your ```config.json```.
      ```json
      {
        "user": "vitraux",
        "services": [
          "http://argos2.hypertopic.org",
          "http://steatite.hypertopic.org"
        ],
        "customization": {
          "vitraux": {
            "facebookComment":{
              "enable":true,
              "Appid":"3798490625XXXXX"
            }
          }
        }
      }
      ```
  5. Done, now you can see the Facebook comment module in each item page.
