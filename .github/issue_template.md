### Mandatory

- [ ] Its topic must be different from the topic of any other existing ticket (open or closed).
- [ ] The ticket must be written in English.
- [ ] Its title must be as short, as user-centered and as explicit as possible:
    - If it is a feature, the title must be the user action (beginning with a verb, and please not `manage`),
    - If it is a bug, the title must describe the intended behavior (with `should`).
- [ ] It must be labeled with a type:
    - `Feature` for a new behavior,
    - `Fix` for the intended behavior which would be different from the current one,
    - `Refactoring` for the exact same behavior but developed in a different way (for better performance, better maintainability, etc.).

### Optional

- [ ] It may be labeled with the affected page (application screen):
    - `Portfolio page`,
    - `Item page`,
    - `Viewpoint page`.
- [ ] It might be labeled with deprecated pieces of Hypertopic software implementing earlier versions of this `feature`:
    - `Replace LaSuli v2`,
    - `Replace Porphyry v6`.
- [ ] If the ticket is for a suggested `fix`, please help us by providing both the intended behavior and the current one as well as a scenario to reproduce the problem.
